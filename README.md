Dark+ Black
===========

VS Code theme based on the default “Dark+” theme, modified to be pure black.

There are also a couple minor syntax highlighting enhancements including:

* Underline class names
* Italic comments (excluding open/close comment tokens)
* Dim grey colored comments
* Brighter grey colored docstring comments.

Looks great with a font with pretty italics, such as:

* [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex)
* [Sometype Mono](https://github.com/dharmatype/Sometype-Mono)
* [Courier Prime](https://github.com/quoteunquoteapps/CourierPrime)
* Consolas (proprietary)
